                <h1>Best &#947; Fitting Method</h1>

    <p>The main goal of this study is to provide a global climate assessment of the performance of the JONSWAP spectrum. The JONSWAP formulation used for this analysis is the one proposed by Goda (1988).</p>

    <p>Although Goda (1988) stated that in different regions of the world the peak-enhancement factor should vary, it is in general considered with its mean value (&#947; = 3.3). The value of &#947; that best fits the <i>E<sub>J</sub>(f)</i> for each sea-state of the hindcast frequency spectrum (<i>E<sub>H</sub>(f)</i>) can be estimated minimizing the SI between the two spectra, in which the number of data considered (N) is the number of the frequencies (32). We refer to the estimated peak-enhancement factor as &#947;<sub>best</sub>.</p>

    <p>Other fitting methods have been applied to fit the spectra data to the JONSWAP. Mazaheri et al. (2019) demonstrated that in the context of the Persian Gulf, varying values of &#947; and &#963; can yield improved storm representations. Additionally, Rueda et al. (2020) introduced a technique that utilizes a genetic algorithm to determine specific JONSWAP parameters.</p>

    <p>In this study, three possible methods were analysed: reducing the SI between the JONSWAP and the hindcast, reducing the SI and considering to match the peak and minimize the areas between the JONSWAP and the hindcast. After checking the performance of these methods, the conclusions led to the use of the first method, reducing the SI between the JONSWAP and the hindcast.</p>

    <p>We estimate the performance of the fitting using the scatter index as follows:</p>

    <p><span class="math display">
        \[
        SI = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{N} (E_{H}(f_i) - E_{J}(f_i))^2}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{N} (E_{H}(f_i))^2}}
        \]
    </span></p>

    <p>SI compares the <i>E<sub>J</sub>(f)</i> with the <i>E<sub>H</sub>(f)</i> along the frequencies.</p>

        <figcaption>Sixty locations worldwide for an in-depth study of the JONSWAP spectrum.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>This metric ranges from 0 (indicating no error) to &#8734; (indicating high error). To facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the global results, five qualitative SI ranges are defined based on the analysis of differences in area, energy peak, <i>H<sub>s</sub></i>, <i>T<sub>e</sub></i>, Pearson coefficient, and kurtosis for various SI values across 60 locations as shown in the figure above.</p>

    <figure>

Red line is the average, green lines are the standard deviation. The SI and all the parameters were computed for the 30 historical years (every 3-hours) for 60 locations. Then the SI was subdivided in different bins from 0.1 to 1 with resolution of 0.1 and the curves were plotted. It can be seen that having SI = 0.4 lead to errors most of the time lower than 20%." style="width: 55%;">
        <figcaption>The subplot represents the errors in percentage on the Area, Energy Peak, m0, m2, k2, Hs, Te, Kurtosis and Pearson coefficient for the frequency spectrum. Red line is the average, green lines are the standard deviation. The SI and all the parameters were computed for the 30 historical years (every 3-hours) for 60 locations.

It can be seen that having SI = 0.4 lead to errors most of the time lower than 20%.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The area parameter represents differences in the area under the curves. Energy peak denotes differences in the magnitude of the maximum energy. &#916; <i>H<sub>s</sub></i> signifies differences in significant wave height. &#916; <i>T<sub>e</sub></i> indicates differences in the energetic period. The Pearson coefficient reflects the ability of the best JONSWAP to capture the pattern of the hindcast spectrum, while kurtosis represents the sharpness or broadness of the spectrum.</p>

    <p>We set the upper limit of the SI to 1, as SI > 1 provides more than 40% of error in all the metrics except for the &#916; <i>H<sub>s</sub></i>, which does not depend on the shape of the spectrum, then having high values of SI does not undermine the <i>H<sub>s</sub></i>.</p>

    <p>SI ranging between 0-0.2 results in errors lower than the 15%, 0.2-0.4 errors between 15-20%, 0.4-0.6 errors between 20-30% and between 0.6-0.8 30-40%. Therefore, the final ranges are: 0 &#8804; SI &#8804; 0.2 Very good, 0.2 < SI &#8804; 0.4 Good, 0.4 < SI &#8804; 0.6 Not good, 0.6 < SI &#8804; 0.8 Poor and 0.8 < SI &#8804; 1 Very poor.</p>

    <p>Note that the qualitative ranges developed here are specifically for the comparison between the hindcast and the fitted JONSWAP spectra. These ranges are intended as a guide to understand the fitting of the JONSWAP spectra. Therefore, similar ranges do not apply to the comparison between the buoy data and the hindcast.</p>

    <p>The figure above demonstrates that maintaining an SI value &#8804; 0.4 yields reliable outcomes regarding the fitting performance of the best JONSWAP against the local hindcast frequency spectrum. This threshold is consistently applied throughout the analysis to assess how well the best JONSWAP aligns with the hindcast frequency spectrum. This approach offers valuable insights into the suitability of the JONSWAP spectrum for each location, considering diverse characteristics.</p>

        <figcaption>Frequency spectra from 3-h sea state of the hindcast (blue), the best fit &#947; JONSWAP (green) and standard JONSWAP (&#947; = 3.3, red)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The figure above presents four instances of the JONSWAP spectrum using &#947;<sub>best</sub> (depicted by the green line, henceforth referred to as the best JONSWAP), the conventional &#947; = 3.3 (depicted by the red line, henceforth referred to as the standard JONSWAP), and the frequency spectrum obtained from the hindcast (depicted by the blue line).</p>

    <p>These examples aim to illustrate typical real-case scenarios encountered in wave climate studies. In general, we observe that the best JONSWAP spectrum exhibits a peak energy and area comparable to those of the hindcast, while the standard JONSWAP tends to overestimate the peak energy.</p>

    <p>The fitting and its performance are assessed at each time step (considering 3-hourly sea states over 30 years, from 1989 to 2018) for each of the 11643 examined locations. This study allows us to analyse cases where the spectral shapes of <i>E<sub>H</sub></i> and <i>E<sub>J</sub></i> differ, even when the bulk sea state parameters are similar.</p>

    <p>In the figure above (panel a) - AS7, Asia, Malaysia [2.5&#176;, 96&#176;]), a favorable agreement in shape is observed between the best JONSWAP and the hindcast frequency spectrum with &#947;<sub>best</sub> &#8776; 3.3. However, in Panel b) (CA3, Central America, Cuba [21.25&#176;, -75.75&#176;]), the standard JONSWAP overestimates the energy peak, while the best JONSWAP, with &#947; &#8776; 1.3, models the shape of the hindcast more accurately.</p>

    <p>Panels c) and d) of the figure highlight the challenge of multi-peaked spectra. Only the peak with the highest energy is well represented by the best JONSWAP. Panel c) (CA3 [CU]) illustrates a location in Central America, Cuba, [21.25&#176;, -75.75&#176;], where a swell and a wind sea coexist and the wind sea has higher energy than the swell. The period of the wind sea is around 5 s, whereas the period of the swells is around 9 s. The JONSWAP spectrum in this case fits the wind sea, with a &#947;<sub>best</sub> of 1.53. Different is the case of panel d) (E1 [IS]) situated in Europe, Iceland [64&#176;, -22.5&#176;]). In this case, the swell has higher energy compared to the wind sea, with a period of about 12 s and 4 s, respectively. The JONSWAP spectrum fits the swell with a &#947;<sub>best</sub> of 1.34.</p>

    <p>In cases of a multimodal spectrum, as the examples illustrated in panel c) and d), it would be preferable to use a multimodal theoretical wave spectrum as the ones proposed by Ochi (1976) and Torsethaugen (1985).</p>

    <p>The spectral shape is a fundamental parameter in ocean-related engineering studies. Nonetheless, differences in shape are not evident when solely comparing <i>H<sub>s</sub></i>. Indeed, despite differences in shape, <i>H<sub>s</sub></i> values for the standard JONSWAP, the best JONSWAP, and the hindcast spectrum are similar.</p>

    <p>In Appendix A, the performance of the best JONSWAP (green line) and the standard JONSWAP (red line) over the hindcast spectrum (blue line) is illustrated across different levels of agreement, starting from a very good agreement with SI as 0.1, progressing to the threshold of 0.4, representing poor agreement, and very poor agreement with SI of 1.5.</p>

    <p>The figure reveals a very good agreement between the best JONSWAP and the hindcast spectrum, encompassing both swells and wind sea. Generally, the best agreement is observed in cases of unimodal and narrow frequency spectra. The figure illustrates a good agreement with SI around 0.4, established as the limit for the best JONSWAP satisfactory performance. In panel AS8, the hindcast frequency spectrum appears very wide, leading to the best JONSWAP with &#947;<sub>best</sub> set to 1, while other locations exhibit a small degree of bimodality. When poor agreement is considered, the hindcast spectrum shows high bimodality, as seen in panel NA5, indicating one swell and one wind sea. The poor performance of the best JONSWAP is attributed to the broadness of the spectrum, a behaviour also observed when SI values hover around 1.5, indicating very poor agreement between the best JONSWAP and the hindcast spectrum.</p>

    <p>The primary objective of this study is to delineate when and where the use of the best JONSWAP is appropriate.</p>
